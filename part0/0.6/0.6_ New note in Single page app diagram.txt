Upon clicking the button on the form, the browser sends the user input to the server.
The Content-Type header in the request informs the server that the enclosed data is
in JSON format.
Additionally, when the submit button is clicked, the browser executes an event handler
that generates a new note, appends it to the list of notes, and updates the note list
on the page. Subsequently, the browser sends the new note to the server.
end note

note over server:
After receiving the request, the server responds with a status code 201, indicating
that the resource has been successfully created. Unlike before, the server does not
request a redirect, so the browser remains on the same page without making any
additional HTTP requests.
The POST request to the "new_note_spa" endpoint includes the newly created note
as JSON data.
end note

note over browser:
As a result, the browser remains on the same page and does not reload the Notes page.

rendering and displaying the notes on the page.
